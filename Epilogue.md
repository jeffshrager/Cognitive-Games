# Epilogue: Creating Your Own Games of the Mind

The games in this book have taken you on a journey through the fascinating terrain of human thought. You’ve explored how we count, recall, interpret, and innovate, uncovering the remarkable processes that power our everyday cognition. But this book is only the beginning.

Everyday life is filled with opportunities to discover how we think, and games provide a powerful framework for doing so. Each activity you’ve encountered in these pages started with a simple question: **What happens in the mind when we do this?** Whether it’s creating meaning from random words, pointing to an imagined location, or navigating probabilities, these games serve as a springboard for deeper understanding.

Now it’s your turn to play the role of game designer.

## Inventing Your Own Games

Creating your own cognitive games is easier than you might think. Start by observing the mental challenges that arise in daily life or brainstorming activities that intrigue you. Ask questions like:
- **What strategies do people use to solve this problem?**
- **How do memory, attention, or creativity come into play?**
- **What biases or shortcuts might influence the outcome?**

From there, craft an activity that highlights these cognitive processes. Keep it simple but engaging—some of the best games require nothing more than paper, a board, or a few spoken words.

## Thinking About Cognitive Processes

As you design and play your games, challenge yourself and your participants to think about *how* they’re thinking:
- What mental tools are being employed?
- Which processes feel natural, and which require effort?

By reflecting on the mechanisms behind each task, you can transform any activity into a window into the mind.
