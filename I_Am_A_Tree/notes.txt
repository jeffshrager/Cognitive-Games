I am a tree (progressive scenes) (5-15 players)

How to Play:
Players stand in a circle. Player A steps into the middle, strikes a pose and announces who or what they represent. For example, Player A stands with arms stretched in a T formation, and says "I am a tree." Player B jumps in to add to the picture, announcing what they represent. For example, they sit curled up underneath Player B’s arms saying “I am an apple.” Player C steps in to complete a scene – for example, laying flat while saying “I am an ant.”

After the scene finishes, Player A leaves and selects another player to leave with them. The other player stays on the stage with their previous role and pose, open for more players to join with new roles. 
Cognitive Insights: 
Creativity and Pattern-Recognition in Decision-Making 
Choosing a role that contributes meaningfully to on-the-fly characters in progressively created scenes requires decision-making with creativity and functionality. Players must think of novel and contextually appropriate roles to contribute to the scene, while thinking of ways to leave room for others. Furthermore, the game is fast-paced with a limit to how many people can be in a scene. Since any player is able to jump in at any given time, players have to make quick decisions on how they themselves can contribute to a scene effectively.

Expanded Cognitive Analysis for I Am a Tree
Creativity and Contextual Improvisation
Players in I Am a Tree engage in an improvisational process that requires creativity and the ability to identify and expand on thematic patterns. Each contribution must be novel yet relevant to the evolving scene. For instance, transitioning from "tree" and "apple" to "ant" requires players to recognize underlying connections (nature, ecosystems) and extend them meaningfully. This taps into conceptual blending, where ideas are merged in innovative ways to maintain coherence while introducing new dimensions.
Pattern Recognition and Decision-Making
Players must quickly recognize the thematic pattern emerging in the scene and determine how to contribute effectively. This requires semantic processing to interpret existing roles and predict how their addition will fit. Furthermore, the fast-paced nature of the game challenges players to balance creativity with strategic planning, ensuring their role complements the scene without dominating or limiting future contributions.
Social Cognition and Group Dynamics
The game emphasizes collaboration, as players rely on theory of mind to predict how their choices will be received by others. Timing is crucial—jumping in too soon or with a role that disrupts the flow can derail the scene. Players must also manage turn-taking and respect others' contributions, fostering a shared sense of narrative ownership.
Cognitive Flexibility and Adaptability
As the scene evolves, players must remain adaptable, ready to pivot their ideas if another player steps in first or the theme shifts unexpectedly. This demands cognitive flexibility, enabling players to rethink their approach and integrate new information dynamically.

Overall Cognitive Insight:
I Am a Tree highlights the interplay between creativity, pattern recognition, and social collaboration. By participating, players enhance their ability to generate novel ideas, adapt to changing contexts, and work as part of a group to build a cohesive and engaging narrative.
