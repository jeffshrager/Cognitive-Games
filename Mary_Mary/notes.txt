How to Play the "Mary Is Both a Bank Teller and an Activist" Game
This game is a thought experiment designed to explore how language, context, and cognitive biases influence interpretation. It works well in classroom settings, encouraging critical thinking about probabilities, semantics, and reasoning.
Setup and Introduction:
Start by introducing a fictional person, Mary, with the following description:
“Mary was deeply involved in political and social activism during her student years. She participated in protests, organized community events, and advocated for social change.”
The Scenario:
After this introduction, present the class with two statements about Mary:
(A) Mary is a bank teller.
(B) Mary is both a bank teller and an activist.
Task for Participants:
Ask the participants to choose which statement they think is more likely: that Mary is simply a bank teller or that Mary is both a bank teller and an activist. Emphasize that they should rely on their intuition and reasoning to decide.
Discussion:
Once everyone has made their choice, ask them to explain their reasoning. Highlight any patterns in how the class interprets the statements, focusing on the role of Mary’s background as an activist.
Then introduce the normative probabilities perspective, emphasizing the logical fallacy of assuming that a more specific condition (Mary being both a bank teller and an activist) is more probable than a broader one (Mary being a bank teller).

Cognitive Insights: Exploring the Role of Context and "Both"
This game highlights key aspects of how people interpret language and make judgments under uncertainty. It also draws attention to the multiple interpretations of "both" in context:
The Conjunction Fallacy:
According to Kahneman and Tversky (1983), many people choose the more specific statement (B) because it aligns with Mary’s activist background. However, this violates normative probabilities since the likelihood of two conditions being true simultaneously (bank teller and activist) cannot exceed the likelihood of either condition alone. This bias is known as the conjunction fallacy.
Contextual Anchoring:
The introduction of Mary as a former activist creates a mental anchor, making participants focus on her activism when evaluating the statements. This context influences their interpretation of "both" as connecting two traits they see as consistent with her identity.
Interpretations of "Both":
The word "both" in statement (B) plays a critical role in shaping participants’ reasoning:
Logical Interpretation: Some participants may interpret "both" as strictly additive, focusing on Mary’s simultaneous possession of the two roles.
Implicit Emphasis: For others, "both" suggests a stronger connection or consistency between the traits. They might reason that Mary’s activist identity makes it more likely she would retain that aspect of herself even as a bank teller.
The dual interpretations of "both" highlight how language subtly frames reasoning processes and shapes decision-making.
Normative Versus Descriptive Reasoning:
The game underscores the tension between normative reasoning (what is logically correct) and descriptive reasoning (how people actually think). While probabilities dictate that statement (A) is more likely, the descriptive reality is that people’s judgments are shaped by narrative coherence and context.

How AI Might Perform at This Task
AI systems provide an intriguing contrast to human reasoning in this game. Their performance would depend on their design and how they handle probabilities, language, and context:
Strengths in Logical Reasoning:
A rule-based AI system or one explicitly programmed with probabilistic logic would correctly identify statement (A) as more likely, adhering to normative probabilities. Such systems excel at tasks requiring strict adherence to mathematical reasoning.
Challenges with Context and Bias:
Language models like GPT, trained on narrative-rich datasets, might favor statement (B) because they integrate context heavily in their reasoning. For example, the model might associate activism with Mary’s description and prioritize narrative consistency over strict probabilities.
Simulating Human Bias:
Interestingly, an AI model designed to mimic human reasoning might replicate the conjunction fallacy if it were trained to emphasize narrative coherence or contextual anchoring. This could make it choose (B) over (A) in a way that aligns with typical human responses.
Limitations in Nuanced Interpretation of "Both":
AI may struggle to fully capture the subtle variations in how "both" is interpreted. While it could logically parse the word as additive, it might miss the implicit emphasis participants place on the term when contextualized with Mary’s background.
