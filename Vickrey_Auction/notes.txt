The $5 Bill Auction (Second Highest Wins)
How to Play:
Setup:
A $5 bill (or any small monetary prize) is offered for auction to the participants.
Rules:
Participants bid on the $5 bill in increments (e.g., $0.10).
The twist: The second-highest bidder wins the $5 bill and pays their bid. The highest bidder pays their bid but wins nothing.
Bidding Process:
Begin the auction, encouraging participants to outbid each other.
Players must carefully weigh their bids, as increasing their bid raises their risk of losing both money and the $5 bill.
The bidding typically escalates rapidly as players attempt to avoid being the second-highest bidder.
Endgame:
The auction concludes when no further bids are made, and the second-highest bidder takes the $5 bill.

Cognitive Insights:
This experiment highlights several key aspects of human decision-making:
Sunk Cost Fallacy:
Players often escalate their bids irrationally because they’ve already invested money and want to "recover" it, even though their additional investment doesn’t improve their odds of winning.
Escalation of Commitment:
The fear of being the second-highest bidder—and losing both the auction and their money—pushes participants to bid higher and higher, sometimes exceeding the value of the $5 bill.
Strategic Thinking:
The game challenges players to think strategically, balancing risk and reward. Savvy bidders may try to cap their bids early or exploit the psychology of others.
Social and Competitive Dynamics:
The game becomes a demonstration of competitive dynamics, where players' decisions are influenced by the actions of others. This can lead to irrational bidding as players focus on beating each other rather than the optimal strategy.

How AI Would Handle It:
Rationality and Game Theory:
An AI designed with a rational decision-making model would calculate the expected value of each bid and stop bidding once the risk outweighs the potential reward. It would avoid the sunk cost fallacy and escalation of commitment entirely.
Exploitation of Human Behavior:
An AI programmed to anticipate human behavior could exploit others' tendencies to overcommit by bidding strategically to force higher bids from human opponents, then withdrawing before it incurs significant costs.
Challenges with Human Interaction:
A key limitation of AI in this game is its inability to experience the psychological pressure of loss, competition, or pride. While it can model optimal bidding strategies, it wouldn’t replicate the emotional dynamics that drive human behavior.

Insights from the Experiment:
This variant of the Dollar Auction provides a vivid illustration of irrational escalation and decision-making traps. By shifting the reward to the second-highest bidder, the game intensifies the psychological stakes, forcing participants to grapple with risk, loss aversion, and competitive pressure. It's a powerful tool for understanding both individual and group behavior in high-stakes situations.
