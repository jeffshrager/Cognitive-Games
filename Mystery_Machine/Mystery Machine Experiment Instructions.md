**Instructions for the Mystery Machine Experiment**

There are 3 parts, usually spanning 2 weeks. Generally you'll do part 1 in the first week, parts 2-4 in the following week.

\=====================================================================  
**Part 1: Training your subject to give a think-aloud protocol on long division**

The goal of this part exercise is to train up a subject in giving a think-aloud protocol, and then get them to do it for you on a somewhat complex learning problem. 

It has two parts:

If you haven't already, be sure that you familiarize yourself with the Mystery Machine. Ensure that you know how to work it, reset it, collect the data, and so forth. Also, try out all the modes of the mystery (?) key.  [(Here's the cheat sheet of what the ? key modes do.)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W8I69iPnnYWLboz-evdCRxiVB9kt5KTOihz8UYQcsDw/edit?usp=sharing)

Find a friend who is not in the class to use as a subject. Since this is an educational exercise, not a formal experiment, you do not need to have your friend sign a waiver. However you do need to get their verbal consent\! You should explain approximately what they will be asked to do, and about how long it will take (under a half hour) and that you will be recording them. The most important part is that they must understand that they are under no pressure to finish the experiment.  They may stop at any time for any reason. A good way to be clear on this is to get them to read this paragraph, or to read it aloud to them, and ask them whether they understand it.

Give your friend a few minutes of think-aloud protocol instruction as discussed in class. A good way to do this is to let them talk into the tape recorder (you don't actually have to turn it on), and to get them to do a reasonably hard long division. (For fun, you can escalate to harder and harder problems if you want to harass your friend\! :-)

Some hints on getting a good think aloud protocol:

* If they stop talking for a moment, ask them what they are thinking, or to "please keep talking".  
* If they say something like "Oh" "I got it" "I'm confused", etc. but don't elaborate, ask them what they mean, what they are thinking.  
* Try your best to stay out of the task yourself; You'll see them making mistakes, but try really hard not to interfere\!

\=====================================================================  
**Part 2: Actually doing a think-aloud protocol on the Mystery Machine**

***You do NOT have to record this part\!***

Before you run your subject in this task, be sure that you are expert at doing it yourself. (You don't need to take a think-aloud protocol on yourself doing it\!) Once you believe that you understand the device well, including what the mystery (?) key does in all the modes, and you have a subject that can give a pretty fair think-aloud protocol, you're really to go for the real thing\!

*Especially be sure you know how to save the transcript (that is, the MM I/O), either by clicking the "Click here to save the transcript" button, or when setting a new mode.*

**2.1 Train the subject in how the Mystery Machine works (*avoiding* the ? key)**

Use the same person you trained in part 1\. Introduce your subject to the Mystery Machine by walking them through several example programs, increasing in complexity. Be sure they understand how it creates its outputs from the inputs. Stick to the plus (+) and minus (-) characters, even though these are slightly confusing. (They are intentionally confusing.)

*YOU CAN LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE FIGURING OUT THE ?*  
*KEY, BUT DO NOT LET THEM USE IT IN THIS PHASE, AND DO NOT SHOW THEM*  
*ANY EXAMPLES OF USING IT.*

**2.2 Let them try a few programs on their own (NOT using the ? key)**

Although you're not recording at this point, I encourage you to get them used to giving a think aloud protocol by talking aloud while they are learning about the Mystery Machine. Ask them to examine the output of each program that you show them, and to explain to themselves (aloud) why each program gives each result. This helps make sure that they get it right.

\=====================================================================  
**Part 3: The main task: The think aloud subject tries to figure out the ? key**

The MM page is probably still open from when you were training your subject (Part 2). If not, open it. In anycase, I suggest reloading the web page. 

**START RECORDING NOW\!**

Choose a mode to use. I suggest starting with mode 3, then moving to mode 6, then mode 2, and finally, if you have time, mode 1\.

Say aloud which one you are in so that it's on the recording.

Enter the mode command yourself. (As above, since I suggest starting with mode 3, enter the "mode 3" command yourself.) Make sure the mode is indicated in the mode indicator under the MM output area. Then clear the mode command. (It doesn't matter if the subject sees you doing this. No need to add more mysteriosity\! :-)

Remind the subject that their goal is to figure out what the ? key does (in this mode).

AND AWAY WE GO\!

Record the subject trying to figure out how the ? key works in the selected mode (initially 3). If they get the right theory on their own, don't just tell them outright; Encourage them to try to prove it to themselves. Let them stop themselves when they are satisfied that they have the right answer. If they can't figure it out in about 15 minutes, stop them and just explain it to them. (Although it's no longer technically a think-aloud protocol at this point, it's useful to keep the recorder going during this "debrief" because you can often get more insight into how they were confused.)

Since mode 3 is pretty easy, it's pretty likely that they'll be able to figure that one out pretty easily. If they do, move on to mode 6 then 2 then, if you have time, or the subject is having fun, challenge them with mode 1, or even mode 5\!

Reminder about getting a good think aloud protocol:

* If they stop talking for a moment, ask them what they are thinking, or to "please keep talking".  
* If they say something like "Oh" "I got it" "I'm confused", etc. but don't elaborate, ask them what they mean, what they are thinking.  
* Try your best to stay out of the task yourself. This is hard\!  
* You'll see them making mistakes, but try really hard not to give hints\!  
* If you do need to step in, give vague guidance, like "maybe look for patterns", or "maybe you can think about using simpler programs".

One additional point regarding taking protocols: As opposed to long division, it's likely that during the actual experiment the subject actually won't be thinking very  much of anything at some points \-- that is, they'll just be confused, so there may be long actual pauses where they are simply dumbfounded. This is okay, but don't let them go on too long like this. If they are silent for more than a few seconds, ask what's going through their head\! Perhaps suggest trying a new program to get them out of their confusion.

When they're satisfied that they know what's going on (or they give up entirely), tell them the correct theory, and give them a little explanation of what we're doing in class, and what you'll be doing  with their tape.  (This is called "Subject debriefing.")

Warning: Be sure that you save the transcripts (that is, the dumps of the MM I/O), either by clicking the button that does it manually, or when the mode changes. (Obviously, use different names for each transcript so they don't overwrite each other\!)  
Aggregate the transcripts (that is, the dumps of the MM I/O) in one file (a gDoc, for example). This is the only thing that needs to be turned in this week.

\=====================================================================  
**Part 4: Analysis**

When you're ready to analyze the results, skim the recording and log for "interesting" episodes \-- ones that were particularly useful for figuring out the ? key, or that were particularly confusing. You'll often find these at points where your friend says things like "Oh, I got it\!" or "Now I'm confused." Find a few of these and produce integrated transcripts. (Please don't send me the audio file.)  Here is a Mystery Machine Transcript Example.  You don't have to stick religiously to this format.

"Interesting" events will usually include: hypotheses, experiments,  and theory changes, specifically:

The setting and resolution of goals: 

* Setting goals to explore a particular theory ("I'm gonna see if the number means ...")   
* Setting goals to interpret the results of an action ("Ugh.  I wonder why it did that?")   
* Setting goals to figure out something internal to the model ( "Now what's the number mean?")   
* Other kinds of goals?   
* If you can tell when a goal is resolved (that is, completed), indicate this.  (This can be difficult. People often go off to something else without saying "Okay, I'm done with that goal now\!", and some goals are dropped without resolution.) 

Types of interactions with the device:

Explorations: ("I'm just trying something (without a specific idea of what it'll do).") 

Experiments ("I'm gonna see if that's right."): for each experiment tell whether it is a "good" experiment or not. That is, does it actually test the hypothesis, and distinguish it from others? 

Exercises: ("I'm just gonna trying out what I know now.") 

Theory changes: When your subject changes their theory, write down (briefly) what their new theory seems to be, if you can figure it out.  Sometimes you won't be able to tell except by looking at their experiments. Sometimes you won't be able to tell at all\!
