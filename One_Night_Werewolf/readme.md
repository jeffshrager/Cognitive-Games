# One Night Werewolf (3-10 players)

## How to Play:
Players are assigned secret roles, such as **werewolf**, **villager**, or **Merlin**, each with conflicting goals. Roles loosely fall into either the “bad people” team or the “good people” team. Through collaboration, deception, and strategy during discussions, players vote to deduce the hidden roles and win as a team or individual.

## Cognitive Underpinnings:

### Strategic Thinking:
- **Planning Moves:** Players must carefully plan their actions, selectively share information, and construct convincing narratives.
- **Persuasive Communication:** Success often depends on the ability to sway others while concealing one’s true intentions, reflecting higher-order reasoning and persuasive skills.

### Adaptability:
- **Navigating Uncertainty:** Players build trust or deceit, orchestrating group dynamics in real-time decision-making.
- **Cognitive Flexibility:** The ever-changing group discussions demand players adjust strategies in response to new alliances, accusations, or revelations.

### Balancing Goals:
- **Game Theory Concepts:** Players experience concepts like Nash equilibria as they weigh individual interests against collective goals.
- **Cooperation and Competition:** The game underscores the complexity of balancing team objectives with personal gain.

## Expanded Cognitive Insights: The Social and Strategic Dance of Deception

### 1. Strategic Thinking and Persuasion
- **Constructing Narratives:** Players craft plausible stories about their roles while subtly steering the group toward their objectives, using a mix of truth, lies, and omissions.
- **Detecting Deception:** Deciphering others’ roles activates critical thinking and theory of mind, requiring players to interpret verbal and nonverbal cues, logical inconsistencies, and behavior.
- **Influencing Others:** Success hinges on persuasion and group dynamics, leveraging techniques like framing arguments, building trust, or instilling doubt.

### 2. Adaptability in a Dynamic Environment
- **Navigating Uncertainty:** With limited information and ambiguous alliances, players adjust strategies in real-time to respond to accusations, alliances, and new revelations.
- **Social Adaptation:** Players adapt their demeanor based on the group’s mood—projecting confidence, feigning innocence, or aligning with consensus.
- **Memory and Tracking:** Success requires tracking evolving claims and counterclaims, remembering who said what and how it aligns with existing knowledge.

### 3. Balancing Goals: Cooperation and Competition
- **Game Theory in Action:** Players weigh individual goals against team objectives, such as werewolves collaborating subtly while protecting themselves or villagers exposing impostors without succumbing to manipulation.
- **Risk and Reward:** Decisions involve evaluating when to reveal or withhold information, balancing short-term gains against long-term outcomes.

### 4. Cognitive Load and Multitasking
- **Mental Simulation:** Players simulate possible outcomes to assess role distributions and refine strategies under uncertainty.
- **Managing Multiple Roles:** Juggling one’s secret role, interpreting others’ roles, and tracking group dynamics places significant demands on working memory and attention.

### 5. Social Cognition and Group Dynamics
- **Theory of Mind and Empathy:** Anticipating others’ strategies requires stepping into their shoes. For example, a villager might think, “If I were the werewolf, how would I respond?”
- **Emotional Regulation:** Success depends on staying calm when accused or projecting sincerity while lying.
- **Trust and Suspicion:** The game emphasizes the balance between trust and suspicion, requiring players to decide whom to trust and when to feign trust.
